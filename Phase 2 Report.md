1.  The study focuses on the Cyclin-dependent Kinase 1 (CDK1) target protein, CHEMBL308, identified from the Chembl database. The bioactivity data for the drug target was obtained through the use of the Google Colab workspace and specific libraries. The IC50 value for CHEMBL308 is recorded as 1752. To enhance accuracy, the dataset underwent pre-processing, which involved the concatenation of three key columns: molecule\_chembl\_id, canonical\_smiles, and standard\_value. Compounds were categorised into three classifications: active, inactive, or intermediate. Compounds exhibiting a concentration of less than 1000 nM were classified as active, those exceeding 10,000 nM were considered inactive, and compounds falling within the range of 1,000 to 10,000 nM were referred to as intermediate.
2.  Molecular descriptors were obtained through the application of specific codes and classified into three categories: Molecular Weight (MW), Number of Hydrogen Donors (NumHDonors), and Number of Hydrogen Acceptors (NumHAcceptors). The IC50 value was converted to the negative logarithmic scale using the formula -log10(IC50), which produced a more uniform distribution of the data.
3.  An Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted by generating a bar chart to illustrate the relationship between the bioactivity class of the drug and its frequency. Additionally, a scatter plot was created to analyse the correlation between molecular weight (MW) and the Octanol/water partition coefficient (Log P).
4.  Molecular descriptors are categorised dimensionally and include many characteristics of molecules. One-dimensional descriptors include bulk characteristics and physicochemical factors such as log P, molecular weight, and polar surface area. They result from a logical and mathematical transition, facilitating qualitative or quantitative examination.
5.  Molecular fingerprints are abstract representations of structural characteristics, crucial for virtual screening and illustrating chemical space. Substructure fingerprints are optimal for tiny compounds such as pharmaceuticals, but atom-pair fingerprints are appropriate for larger molecules like peptides.
6.  The bioactivity class that was plotted against frequency shows that there are more active compounds, thereby considered to be potent for the therapeutic target. The scatter plot of MW vs Log P on the other hand, also showed numerous active compounds comprising pIC50 values ranging between 2 and 8, as shown in the diagram.
7.  The train and test sets were created using an 80/20 split methodology. Subsequently, the model was developed utilising the RandomForestRegression function, specifying n\_estimators to determine the number of trees to be generated and random\_state to ensure reproducibility.
8.  The.predict() function is needed to test the model, and the.fit() function is needed to run the model. The results were obtained through the application of the mean\_absolute\_error and mean\_squared\_error functions. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was calculated to be 1.06 (2 decimal places), while the Mean Squared Error (MSE) was determined to be 1.85 (2 decimal places). The R² score was 0.120.
9.  The model underwent cross-validation, yielding an average of -0.177 (2 decimal places) and a standard deviation of 0.23 (2 decimal places).
