**Phase 1: Docking Implementation**

**Introduction**

Renal cancer is the predominant malignant tumor of the kidney, originating in the kidney cells (Eisenberger _et al.,_ 1999). Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1 (CDK1) protein, which plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation, is a promising target for cancer treatment (Li _et al.,_ 2022). CDK1 overexpression and hyperactivation correlate with the uncontrolled proliferation of renal cancer cells; thus, inhibiting this protein may induce cell cycle arrest, offering a potential therapeutic advantage (Sager _et al.,_ 2022).

**Panax Ginseng**

_Panax ginseng_ is a medicinal plant recognized for its bioactive compounds, which exhibit antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects in multiple cancer studies (Jakaria _et al.,_ 2018; Meng _et al.,_ 2024). This study investigates the therapeutic potential of _Panax ginseng_ in renal cancer treatment via its interaction with CDK1 proteins and evaluates the molecular docking of phytochemicals derived from _Panax ginseng_ with CDK1 to determine their potential as inhibitors of CDK1 in the treatment of renal cancer.

**Methodology**

A.    Protein Identification

Cyclin-dependent Kinase 1 (CDK1) has been found on the Human Protein Atlas as a marker of poor prognosis in renal cancer. The protein structure, identified by PDB ID **6GU6** (a CDK1/Cks2 complex complexed with Dinaciclib), was obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank.

**Fig 1: 6GU6 Protein**


B.    Active Sites of the Protein

The protein's active sites were identified using the CASTp computational software, revealing the sequence Methionine, Tyrosine, Threonine, Lysine, Isoleucine, Glycine, Glutamic acid, Arginine, Histidine, Glutamine, Leucine, Serine, Valine, Proline, Phenylanine, Aspartatic acid, and Alanine. Their visualization was conducted using the PyMol software.

C.    Phytochemical Library

A total of 52 phytochemicals from the plant were identified through published literature, and their 2D structures were obtained in SDF format from the PubChem library. The structures were subsequently converted into 3D formats (PDB) utilizing the Open Babel website.

D.    Docking

MGL Tools, Autodock 4, and Autodock Vina were acquired and used for the molecular docking of the protein and phytochemicals. Autodock 4 was used to prepare and convert the protein from PDB to PDBQT format by removing the Dinaciclib ligand (1QK) and water molecules, checking and repairing missing atoms, and adding polar hydrogens and Kollman charges. The three-dimensional structures of the phytochemicals were generated and converted into PDBQT format. A grid box was generated via Autodock 4. Autodock Vina was then used for docking the protein with the phytochemicals, using an energy range of 4 and an exhaustiveness of 8. The docking findings yielded 9 binding affinities for each phytochemical, with the greatest affinity recorded first. The result and protein conformation were visualised via PyMOL.

E.    Results

The 52 phytochemicals were docked with the 6GU6 protein and visualised using PyMOL; however, only 10 with the highest affinity were selected for this result.

**Conclusion**

Docking analysis demonstrated that Ginsenoside F2 and Ginsenoside Rg3 exhibit the highest binding affinities to the 6GU6 protein, particularly at its active sites. Ginsenoside F2 displayed the highest potential as a CDK1 inhibitor in renal cancer, with a binding affinity of -12.5 kcal/mol.
